                    <p class="h2" >Summary</p>
                        <p>When new friends are asked to describe me often they use adjectives like 'funny' or 'observant' maybe 'charasmatic'. To old friends I am 'dependable' and 'loyal'. To my DJ clients I am 'skilled' and 'musical' But a characteristic that not many would notice and probably my most cherished is I am a hard-working person. I enjoy a seeing a problem and seeing the solution come to fruition.</p>
                        <p>These attributes are a portion of who I am, and most of them are backed by experiences where I had to learn and grow into that characteristic. In the journey of becoming who I am I have had the opportunity to wokr in several jobs and be part of some incredible things. Here is a list of some of my favorite memories and achievements, I hope they give you an insight into who I am.</p>
                            <p class="h3"> Achievements</p> 
                            <ul>
                                <li><u>Eagle Scout</u></li>
                                <p>As part of completing my Eagle Scout I organized and helped execute the annual Special Needs Olympics. As part of this event I gathered 100 volunteers and assigned them over a specific aspect of the event; the Turbo Jav. This particular event taught me about inclusion and the value people with special needs add to our community.</p>
                                <li><u>Boys State</u></li>
                                <p>This event happend some years ago but it symbolizes a great commitment to my community that I still carry with me. Boys State is a summer camp that contains students picked from each highschool in your state. Those students get to create a mock government and enact laws and learn about the democratic process. Through a series of events I ended the week as the Secretary of State which was the 2nd highest position. I learned the value of connections and how important my responsibility is as a citizen.</p>
                                <li><u>2 Year Church Mission</u></li>
                                <p>This experience is not a unique event here at BYU but my particular circumstane may be. I served 10 months in SLC and Colombia during Covid before being sent home. I was not sure if I would return but after 9 months of growth and reflection I decided to return and finish what I started. all in all the time from when I started to finished was almost 3 years. Through the process of returning I learned the value of perservering for a cause greater than yourself.</p>
